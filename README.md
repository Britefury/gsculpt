# gSculpt

gSculpt is a procedural 3D subdivision polygon modeller that was developed between 1999 and 2009. It has a comprehensive set of polygon modelling tools, including most of those found in [Wings 3D](http://www.wings3d.com/) and more.

Workflow and speed of use are supported by pre-selection highlighting and keyboard short cuts. A powerful procedural system records the steps required to construct the model, allowing mistakes to be rectified easily.

The procedural modelling system makes it an excellent choice for making modelling tutorials, as the steps required to build the model from the beginning are displayed to the user in a list. This list can be navigated easily, allowing a user to view the process one step at a time at their own pace, while being able too look at the model from all angles as they go.

gSculpt can import and export Wavefront Object (.obj) model files.

A Windows binary can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/Britefury/gsculpt/releases) page.
