# Background

When the project started in 1999, it was inspired by a program called Cybersculpt which was developed by Tom Hudson for the Atari ST platform. During the period of 2000-2001, a procedural modelling system was implemented, whereby gSculpt operates on the procedure required to build a model from scratch, rather than operating on the geometry itself. After that, gSculpt went under the radar, while development continued. It now has features that are present in most modern subdivision modelling programs. gSculpt was initially written entirely in C++, however, in 2005 it was decided that a significant portion of the code should be rewritten in Python, in order to take advantage of the productivity benefits that arise from using dynamic languages. gSculpt as it currently stands uses C++ only for the mathematically intensive operations, using Python for the remainder of the code base.
