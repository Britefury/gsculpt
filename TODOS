Additional tools:
	constrained edge loop/ring/boundary selection
	edge ring/loop next/prev


Axis layout for OBJ importer (Y-up / north)
Faster OBJ importer
Nodes that are deleted remain in the project
Further investigate bug that can occur while using tweak tool; something to do with picking acceleration
Help system
Handle image loading errors
Passing Array<Matrix4> as result parameter in computePathMatrices() in PolylinePath; look into using a custom malloc()/free() for array allocator.
Look into tooltips for the viewport layout combo box, and node view settings button.
UI action system
Try to come up with a way of handling exceptions during saving, that a) warns the user b) still gives a stack dump
Project authorship / copyright and modification info. (include a change log?)
Request: Default name for new nodes
Request: Paint-selection
Request: Editable mouse (?)
Request: path extrusion
Tool errors.
Multi-layer rendering and backface-culling toggles.
Mark region shapes.
Camera navigation mode.
Make shortcuts editor warn user of existing shortcuts using a key.
Pick compression; add hashing to gSculpt.Math.Projection so that repeated projections can be detected and compressed out.
Tooltips for the picture icons.
Highlight non-quad faces.
Pick highlights sometimes remain.
ImageError exception not handled; load an indexed image.
Look into the navigation event handler grab on button presses.
Combine path pick into the pick tools.
Combine pick edge loops+rings into pick edges tool.
Prev/next ring/loop.
New context menu system.
Wings/Blender style workflow.
Hypertweak tool.
Use numeric keypad keys for switching views; top, left, front, etc.
Fix GSProduct memory usage tracking system. It does not work properly due to the live subdivision system changing memory usage after objects have been cached.

Check manipulators:
	_o_setUISensitivity on the following:
		Knife tool
		Mark region
		Surface tweak
		Tweak
		Template tweak
	It is not implemented. Check other manipulators that derive from manipulator helpers that implement this functionality.








HACK: Bug in scene view: 1. Create a node   2. Zoom out   3. Create a second node   4. Zoom in   => node is not visible
	Hack-fix in SceneEditorTools.py: SceneEditorTools.p_onZoomToggled()
