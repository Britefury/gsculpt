- Implemented virtual mirror.
  C++ VisualPlane class implemented; stores visual plane information (rotation/normal, position, size) for virtual mirror, drawing plane, etc.
  GSProductModel modified to store virtual mirror plane. MeshPainter modified to paint the reflected geometry when virtual mirror is active.
  ToolVirtualMirror implemented which allows the user to enable and edit the virtual mirror.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/03/2006)

- Implemented mesh mirror tool. Gets reflection plane form virtual mirror settings.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/03/2006)

- Unified Variable and ObjectSource class hierarchies; GenericReadOnlyVarInterface now implements the ObjectSource interface.
  ObjectSource.invalidatedSignal renamed to ObjectSource.changedSignal; GenericReadOnlyVarInterface.changedSignal removed.
  BasicObjectSource renamed to CachedObjectSource.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/03/2006)

- Implemented unsaved data warning dialog that is invoked when the user attempts to create a new project, open a project, or quit the
  application, when there is unsaved data.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/03/2006)

- SceneNode name now handled by a FieldColumn, rather than using hand-written code. This ensures that the command history will track
  changes to the node name without specific code having to be written to do this.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Renamed 'Connect edges' tool to 'N-Connect edges', renamed 'Parametric connect edges' tool to 'Connect edges'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Renamed 'Split edges' tool to 'N-Split'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Implemented 'Split edges' tool; the user specifies the points at which the edges are split.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Implemented possible/hack fix for a bug that caused nodes in the scene view to be hidden incorrectly.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Exposed the BackFaceCull C++ class hierarchy and the mesh knife functionality to Python in preparation for the implementation of the
  knife tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/03/2006)

- Implemented the knife tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/03/2006)

- Fixed inset faces adjustment limits bug.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/04/2006)

- Implemented pick edge loop path and pick edge ring path tools.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/04/2006 - 02/04/2006)

- Fixed bugs that prevented composite fields and row reference fields from loading and saving.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/04/2006)

- Tested all procedures to ensure that they load and save correctly. Several bugs were found and fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/04/2006)

- Fixed a bug that caused the unsaved data dialog to be displayed even when all changes have been saved.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/04/2006)

- Modified the MainApp.p_writeFile() method so that the XML document is built before opening the file to write. This prevents the case
  where a file is truncated to zero length, the document creation process fails due to error, and as a result the existing contents of
  the file are lost.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/04/2006)

- Implemented 'overwrite existing file' warning/confirmation dialog box.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/04/2006)

- Changed MMesh::computeExpansionVector(); the least-sum-of-square-error method of computing an expansion vector is
  conceptually elegant, however can produce ugly results in practice. The new method computes the average of the normals,
  and then scales the average normal so that the dot product of the average normal, and each normal, is kept closest to 1.0 on average.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/04/2006)

- Modified the 'connect marked edges' tool so that terminal vertices can be chosen.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the graph view. When the current scene is destroy by creating a new scene, or loading one from a file,
  the graph view selection maintained references to some of the old nodes. This caused stack dumps and unpredictable behavior when
  selecting nodes in the graph view. The graph node selection was modified so that when the current GSGraph is detached, all selection
  information is cleared.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the scene command tracker which prevented changes to nodes that were loaded from a file from being
  tracked. This was due to the fact that when the scene command tracker started to track a scene, it did not start tracking all of the
  nodes within the scene; tracking was only started for newly created nodes.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/04/2006)

- Modified gsculpt.py so that a project file can be loaded by specifying its path at the command line.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/04/2006)

- Replaced custom image loading system with the Python Imaging Library. This removes any issues with linking to libjpeg which can
  occur on some systems (e.g. Cygwin or MinGW), and adds support for a significant number of image file formats.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/04/2006)

- Moved Python source hierarchy into the gSculpt directory.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/04/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the 2d scale and translation handles which caused a stack dump upon use, due to the mis-handling of constraints.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/04/2006)

- Changed the description of that 'target weld vertices' tool so that it appears as 'Target weld vertices' instead of 'Cut'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/04/2006)

- Changed default value of the 'per region' parameter of the flatten vertices tool to 'off'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/04/2006)

- Added a shortcut to the edge toolset for clean dissolve (normal dissolve with 'clean dissolve' enabled); it can be accessed
  with <shift>-V.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the translation handle that caused NaNs to appear in the translation vector, when the initial
  pointer position and the current pointer position are the same. It was caused by attempting to normalise the delta vector
  (0,0,0) to the length of the delta vector transformed by a matrix. This divide by zero caused the NaNs. This condition is now
  checked for.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/04/2006)

- Added the 'gsculpt' shell script which sets the necessary environment variables before running gSculpt. This is required for
  gSculpt to run on Ubuntu systems. Thanks to Rory Yorke for his assistance in this matter.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/04/2006)

- Modified C++ files so that classes and functions are exported in order to produce Windows DLLs.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/04/2006)

- Modified SConstruct so that gSculpt can be built on the Win32 platform in addition to the Linux platform.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed bugs that caused gSculpt to crash on the Win32 platform. This was caused by classes that had 'Array'
  objects as member variables, and declared inline methods that would cause 'Array' to allocate and free memory. This resulted
  in a situation where memory was allocated within one DLL and freed within another. This seems to be a dangerous practice,
  so all classes that have 'Array' objects as members, or derive from 'Array', had their method implementations moved into .cpp
  modules, rather than declared inline inside header files.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/04/2006)

- Model layer system implemented; background layers can be created, renamed and deleted, via the new layer editor window.
  Scene nodes can be added to the layers from the scene graph window. Layers and nodes can be hidden from the layer editor
  window. Visible nodes in visible layers are painted in the background. A command tracker was implemented so that operations
  performed on the layers can be undone.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (22/04/2006)

- Implemented default layer selection combo box to go into the top left corner of the scene editor window, so that a default layer
  can be chosen into which new scene nodes are placed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (22/04/2006)

- Implemented the 'GL resource guard'. It is a small widget that appears in the bottom right corner of the main window. It is a
  small GL drawing area which uses the same 'sharing manager' as the viewports, thus ensuring that OpenGL objects such
  as textures and display lists are not destroyed and re-created when the viewport layout is changed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/04/2006)

- Added a layout accelerator; '<ctrl>-W' switches between quad and single viewport layouts.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/04/2006)

- All background layers were effectively 'live'; the 'product' of each node displayed in the background layers was kept up
  to date at each 'tick'. This caused performance problems when editing produces that are not at the end of a procedure list,
  when the node is visible in a background layer, as each editing operation would cause the background layer system to
  execute the subsequent procedures. This caused performance problems. The problem was resolved by modifying the
  background layer painter system so that it only refreshes the 'product' of a node when the visible node list changes,
  or the current (current editing) node is changed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/04/2006)

- Implemented Wavefront .OBJ format exporter.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/04/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the background model layer painter that caused a stack dump when trying to display a blank node. This
  was caused by the painter factory returning 'None' when asked to create a painter for a blank node. Attempting to
  call methods on this object raised an exception.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/04/2006)

- Implemented rectangular region selection tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (28/04/2006)

- Fixed some crash bugs caused by the 'freeing memory in one so/dll that was allocated in another' problem. Fixed by
  de-inlining Python wrapper methods in GSProductMesh.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (28/04/2006)

- Moved MMesh so that it is a subdirectory of Mesh. MMesh is now linked into the Mesh so/dll.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/04/2006)

- The 'pick edge rings' tool appeared as 'pick edges' in the plan list.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the 'connect marked edges' mesh operation. Some vertices were 'secondary marked'
  during the operation, and left that way after the operation was finished, causing subsequent operations to fail.
  The 'secondary marking' was found to be unnecessary, so that piece of code was removed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/04/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the model layer painter. ModelLayerBackgroundPainer.forceRefreshLayers() attempted
  to iterate over the entries list without refreshing it. In the case where changes to the node list resulted in the entry list
  being invalidated by setting it to 'None', this resulted in attempting to iterate over a non-sequence. Fixed by checking
  if the entry list is valid before attempting to iterate over it.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/05/2006)

- Implemented the extrude edges tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/05/2006)

- Added short cuts for inset faces and bevel faces with 'flow through marked edges' enabled.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/05/2006)

- Changed shortcuts for modify and remove plan actions from <shift>-M and <shift>-Delete respectively, to
  <control>-M and <control>-Delete.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/05/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the ProjectionRegion3d serialisation code.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/05/2006)

- Fixed Win32 version. Thanks to Rob Marriott (350kilotons) for his help in tracking down these issues.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/05/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the Field/Object field system. An ObjectField can have its 'value' set to None. However,
  Field.setValue() which ObjectField inherited, did not allow this and failed an assert. This resulted in a stack dump when
  undo is invoked on procedures that contain object fields (e.g. Knife) when the value is reset to None. Solved by
  adding the o_checkValueType() method to Field that checks the type of the value. ObjectField overloads this to
  allow None to be accepted.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/05/2006)

- Added instructions to tool panels.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/05/2006)

- Rob Marriott discovered a bug on the Win32 version where using the viewport type (perspective/orthographic/etc)
  selection combo box causes the application to freeze. The combo popup refuses to disappear, and keeps its lock
  on mouse input. This is due to the combo being de-parented in response to the combo box 'changed' signal.
  Calling GtkComboBox.popdown() in the ComboBox response method forces the popup to disappear, thus resolving
  the issue. It would initially seem that redesigning the viewports may seem to be the better solution, however, having
  the combo boxes limited in that they cannot be de-parented or re-parented in response the 'changed' signal makes
  them more difficult to use, so modifying ComboBox was the solution eventually used.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug with the view layout short cut; the layout is changed, however, the layout selection
  combo box does not change to reflect this.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2006)

- Added tooltips to the tools in the top toolbar.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2006)

- Changed the default value for the 'ignore back-facing' setting on the mesh mark region tools to 'off'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2006)

- Changed the title of the selection tools in the mesh tool sets from 'Mark' to 'Select', for consistency.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2006)

- Implemented tabbed/notebook viewport layout.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/05/2006)

- Changed the default value of the 'weld linked vertices' option in the weld vertices tool to 'off'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/05/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug that prevented region select from saving correctly; XML IO had not been implemented
  for BBox2 and BBox3.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (08/05/2006)

- Implemented initial version of the new tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/05/2006)

- Attempted to fix manipulator/handle bug which causes a (harmless, so far) traceback. Unknown if this will fix it
  though.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/05/2006)

- Added a target list editor to the tweak tool UI.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/05/2006)

- Modified the tweak tool manipulator so that the middle button can be used to perform fine adjustments.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/05/2006)

- Added the capability to use positive indices to the OBJ exporter. It is presented to the user as an export option.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/05/2006)

- Added safe mesh import functionality to MMesh; faces which cause problems (e.g. faces which would result
  in an edge having more than 2 incident faces, or inconsistent face direction) are ignored, rather than causing
  an assert to fail.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/05/2006)

- Implemented an S-expression tree generator and parser. This allows arbitrary data structures to be serialised
  into an ASCII format which can be used as character data to pass to the XML generator.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/05/2006)

- Added IO methods to the GSProduct class hierarchy to allow them to be serialised to and de-serialised from
  S-exression trees.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/05/2006)

- Implemented an OBJ importer. An 'imported model' procedure and tool was added so that imported models
  can be added to a plan. The importer takes each model from an OBJ file and creates a scene node for it.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/05/2006)

- Modified the OBJ exporter so that it defaults to writing positive indices, instead of negative.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/05/2006)

- Implemented the flip tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/05/2006)

- Fixed bug in OBJ importer which would allow faces with duplicate/repeated vertices to be imported. These faces
  are now split so that no face has any duplicate/repeated vertices.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (15/05/2006)

- Improved compatibility of OBJ importer by allowing it to handle indices with a value of 0, by ignoring them.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/05/2006)

- Added 'merge' option to OBJ importer so that the file can be imported into one scene node, rather than one
  for each object.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/05/2006)

- Modified MMesh so that face planes, face tesselation, and vertex normals are now computed on demand.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (18/05/2006)

- Export OBJ dialog correctly sets the initial filename now.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/05/2006)

- The 'open', 'save as', 'import OBJ', and 'export OBJ' dialogs now have file format filters.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/05/2006)

- Improved the BBox3->Segment3 intersection test routine by using the algorithm from David Eberly's
  Geometric Tools website (http://www.geometrictools.com).
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/05/2006)

- Implemented bounding box tree raytrace acceleration system, that is used to accelerate picking.
  This considerably improves the performance of picking vertices, edges, and faces.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/05/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the target weld vertices tool. Discovered by Maximlian Eham. It was due to the manipulator
  attempting to use both 'None' and '-1' (inconsistently) as values used to indicate an invalid index. Fixed
  by standardising on '-1', as '-1' is returned by the GSProductMesh (C++) methods to indicate an invalid
  index.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (25/05/2006)

- A confirmation dialog is presented to the user when they attempt to export and OBJ file when the file
  already exists.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/05/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the mesh importer (used by the OBJ importer) which can cause the import operation to
  fail an assertion for certain meshes. The crash occurred when some faces had to be flipped in order to ensure
  face direction consistency. This was due to the MMesh::flipFaceRegion() method asserting that the mesh
  is finalised. The assertion failed due to the import operation being incomplete. MMesh::flipFaceRegion()
  no longer asserts that the mesh is finalised.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/05/2006)

- Implemented scripting window.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/05/2006)

- Downloaded PyConsole, written by Yevgen Muntyan, from http://www.berlios.de. This is now included
  in the gSculpt distribution, as a replacement for ScriptArea, the gSculpt scripting area widget. It offers
  additional features such as command history, and command completion.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (28/05/2006)

- Renamed 'icons' directory to 'gsimages'.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (28/05/2006)

- Yevgen Muntyan merged the changes that I made into pyconsole. Incorporated the new version into gSculpt.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/05/2006)

- Added a 'Run script' menu item to the script menu, which allows the user to run a Python script file.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/05/2006)

- Added exportProduct() and exportProducts() functions to ObjExport. This will be useful for scripting.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/05/2006)

- Yevgen Muntyan made some further changes to pyconsole. They have been incorporated into gSculpt.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/05/2006)

- Modified attribute and method naming to be consistent with Python conventions.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/05/2006)

- Fixed some bugs in the mesh importer that failed to handle certain cases where faces had duplicate vertices.
  Any faces with less than 3 vertices are now skipped.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/06/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the target weld tool that caused gSculpt to abort. It was due to the fact that MMesh::pickFace()
  did not ignore faces that were marked as destroyed, resulting in destroyed faces (and therefore destroyed edges or vertices)
  being picked to operate on.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/06/2006)

- The greenlets coroutines system that is part of pylib was downloded from http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/home.html and
  has been incorporated into gSculpt. Coroutines/greenlets can simplify event-driven code by allowing algorithms to be written
  in an imperative manner, rather than having to convert them to an event driven form. The target weld manipulator was refactored
  to use greenlets as a proof of concept.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/06/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a crash bug in the connect marked edges tool. It was due to the fact that code did not check the picked
  seed edge to see if it was NULL.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/06/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the mesh bounding box tree.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/06/2006)

- Added constraints (axis/plane) to the tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/06/2006)

- Implemented the new 'tweak components' tool that replaces the old tweak tool. This tool allows the user to tweak vertices,
  edges, edge rings, edge loops, and faces, all from within one tool, easily switching between the component types.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/06/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the mesh bounding box tree that could cause crashes. It was due to accessing an uninitialised part of the
  face index array.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/06/2006)

- Improved the workflow of the target weld vertices tool so that you click the source and drag to the target, rather than clicking
  on the source and then clicking on the target. Also, a line is now drawn from the source to the highlighted target.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/06/2006)

- Visibility of cut segments (for cut manipulators) improved.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/06/2006)

- Optimised bounding box tree due to performace problems with the tweak tool. The bounding box tree is no longer rebuilt after
  each change. It is rebuilt when the mesh topology changes. If the only changes made are to vertex positions, then it is
  'refreshed'. This is done by recomputing the bounding boxes of the tree nodes, but leaving the tree structure as it is. This is
  faster then rebuilding the tree, but the box tree will not be as optimal (for ray-trace queries) as a newly built one. A query cost
  heuristic is computed after each refresh, and compared with a threshold (the cost after a the last rebuild, multiplied by a
  factor). If the threshold is reached, the tree is rebuilt from scratch.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/06/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the OBJ exporter.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/06/2006)

- Fixed a performance problem in the XML IO system that was triggerred by nodes with large content strings, such as nodes
  that contain imported mesh data. This was due to the fact that the content is presented by the XML parser in small chunks.
  The response function would append this chunk to the content string of the current node. When the overall content is 2MB
  in size for example, these append operations take a long time, as 2MB has to be copied in order to append a few hundred
  bytes. This was replaced by a system that builds up a list of chunks, and upon receiving notification of the end of the node
  being reached, the list is joined using the str.join() function. This is much faster.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/06/2006)

- Improved the performance of the tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/06/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug that caused the command history (undo system) to misbehave. It was caused by a call to
  CommandHistory.freeze() without a matching call to CommandHistory.thaw().
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/06/2006)

- Reversed the scroll direction of the tweak tool when using the scroll wheel to change the tweak target type, or the axis
  constraints. This ensures that moving the wheel downward moves the radio selection downward.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/06/2006)

- The Win32 version of gSculpt can now be built using py2exe, resulting in gSculpt needing only a single installer now.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/06/2006)

- When the tweak tool is invoked, the target type is initialised to either vertices, edges, or faces, depending upon which tool
  set was used to invoke it.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (18/06/2006)

- Dissolve marked faces tool will now mark the merged faces by default.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/06/2006)

- Removed 'smart' texture co-ordinate generation from the collapse edges function, as the 'smart' texture co-ordinates are
  probably not that useful.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/06/2006)

- Fixed the texture co-ordinate generation in the collapse faces function.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/06/2006)

- Implemented collapse faces tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/06/2006)

- Implemented an FPU precision control module. This allows the FPU precision to be limited to double-precision (as opposed to the
  x86 default of extended/long double). There are some cases in which the extra precision causes a model building procedure to
  be interpreted incorrectly. This used to be fixed with the -ffloat-store flag when compiling with GCC. This caused the intermediate
  results of computations to be stored and read back, resulting in the unnecessary precision being truncated. This was a problem
  due to there being no equivalent flag on MSVC (as far as I know). This could result in versions of gSculpt compiled using different
  compilers being incompatible with one another. The FPU precision control module should fix this. gSculpt now sets the precision
  to double-precision on startup.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/07/2006)

- Implemented the 'Create' menu which provides a fast way of creating a new node with a primitive object.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/07/2006)

- Refactored model layer system so that the default layer for new nodes is stored by the model layer table. By responding to the
  'scene node added' signal emitted by a scene object, nodes are placed in this layer. This removes the need for having to
  go through the SceneEditorTools.addSceneNode() method to ensure that a new node is added to the default layer.
  In order to support this change, an object variable class (ObjectVar) was added to the Kernel/Variable module, and a combo-box
  variable editor class (ChoiceVarEditComboBox) was added to the VarEdit module.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/07/2006)

- Implemented spin edges tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/07/2006)

- Implemented rewire edges tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/07/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the model layer command tracker that caused a stack dump when undoing the creation of a scene node.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/07/2006)

- Modified command trackers and their respective data/model classes so that they are informed directly of changes, instead of via the
  signals and slots system. Sometimes, listeners that respond to signals will make modifications to other data. These changes in turn
  could generate commands to be placed on the command history. The sequence in which  these modifications are made, and the changes
  are tracked by the command tracker is important, as the data/model needs to be in the correct state for the commands from the
  command history to work properly when executed or unexecuted during a redo or undo operation. This ordering cannot be ensured using
  only the signals and slots sytem.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/07/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the plan / plan command tracker interaction that caused a stack dump when undoing an action that appended a
  procedure to a plan.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/07/2006)

- Maximlian Eham discovered a bug in the mesh subdivision system which resulted in crashes due to vertex normals not being generated.
  Fixed by modifying MVertex::clearLinks() so that it calls MVertex::topologyModified(), and modifying MVertex::topologyModified() so
  that it sets the 'normalsRequireRefresh' flag.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/07/2006)

- Maximlian Eham discovered a bug which caused gSculpt to crash when vertices are deselected using the shortcut, while the move tool
  is active (and has been used) with smooth rendering active. It occurred when attempting to copy a mesh. It resulted from attempting to
  compute a vertex normal when the mesh was not yet complete, in that all faces had not yet been copied. A crash resulted from
  attempting to access fields from a face that had not yet been initialised.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/07/2006)

- Made the following modifications to the rewire edges tool:
  1. Rewire edges now works when the two faces incident to the edge being rewired share more than one edge
  2. Better feedback given to the user when the proposed selection is invalid
  3. Fixed a bug in the UI code that could cause a stack dump
  *Note: could cause compatibility issues.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/07/2006)

- Implemented scene node view settings system. Used it to implement live subdivision.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/07/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the component transform code which could cause crashes. Calls to MMesh::finalise() had been omitted.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/07/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the Manipulator/Handle module that caused stack dumps during a drag operation, when the 'switch
  viewport layout' short-cut is activated during the drag operation. This was due to the pointer leaving the original viewport, and entering
  a new one during the drag operation. This would result in attempting to continue the drag operation with a viewport for which handle
  data had not been initialised.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/07/2006)

- Implemented new graph view system that uses Cairo to render the scene graph, rather than GTK button widgets. This has resulted in
  the following improvements:
  1. User placed nodes.
  2. Improved visual appearance.
  3. A scene graph with thousands of nodes could deplete GDI resources on the Win32 platform due to the creation of thousands of
     windows for all the GTK button widgets.
  4. Improved zooming and panning; basically the same as viewport zooming and panning.
  GTK+ v2.8 and above is now a requirement for gSculpt.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/08/2006)

- Refactored the graph handling code out of GSSceneNode and GSScene into two new classes (GSFunctionGraphNode and
  GSFunctionGraph), that make up the new GSFunctionGraph module. These classes manage a GSGraph. The node class derives from
  GSFunction, thus it adds support for the database system provided by the Kernel.Row class, and method parameter extraction system
  provided by GSFunction. Sinks and sources can be declared as columns in classes that derive from GSFunctionGraphNode.
  Graph serialisation is supported, which is not provided by GSGraph.
  These changes will ease the implementation of new uses of the graph system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (12/08/2006)

- Implemented a new scene node type; the procedure node.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/08/2006)

- Implemented the 'New Node Menu'; the new node menu pops up when the 'New' button in the scene editor window is clicked. It allows the
  user to choose one of a number of different types of node to create.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/08/2006)

- Discovered and fixed bugs in the BBox2::intersects(Segment2) and BBox3::intersects(Segment3) methods, which were due to a
  mis-interpretation of David Eberly's code at http://www.geometrictools.com.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/08/2006)

- Implemented a graph view control menu. The menu contains options that allow the user to focus on the origin, zoom to 1:1, zoom to view
  extents of all nodes, and zoom to view extents of selected nodes.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/08/2006)

- Fixed all C++ code that uses boost::python to acquire values from Python objects. The use of the boost::python::extract system was
  incorrect and prone to crashing.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/08/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the mesh importing code that caused a crash when a texture co-ordinate is not specified for a vertex.
  This was due to the lack of texture co-ordinate not being handled.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/08/2006)

- Implemented a bug work-around to fix two crashes that affect the Win32 version of gSculpt. Calling glDeleteTextures() causes a crash.
  This results in gSculpt crashing on exit, and crashing when the image file of a background image is changed. Fixed by creating a new
  boost::python based wrapper for glDeleteTextures. It is loaded to replace the glDeleteTextures provided by pyOpenGL.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/08/2006)

- Implemented bug work-arounds to fixed issues with the Win32 version of Cairo. Passing empty strings to either cairo.Context.text_extents()
  or cairo.Context.show_text() causes a MemoryError exception to be raised. Wrapper functions were implemented to handle this case.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/08/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the graph view that resulted in newly created nodes having their positions initialised such that they occupied the same spot.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/08/2006)

- Fixed a bug in GSFunctionGraph that resulted in old files loading to produces nodes with unnamed pins. Fixed by ensuring that pins that
  are 'instances' of pin columns have their name set by their respective columns at load time.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/08/2006)

- Implemented transformations/deformations
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/09/2006)

- Redesigned the function tool and procedure tool data source system. The old system was too limited, as it simply took the input object/product
  and applied a function to it to get the data required (for positioning a manipulator). The new transformation/deformation tools require additional
  information from the row/function/procedure being edited (e.g. the target (points or body), transformation/deformation frame rotation, etc).
  The new system works using a decorated function. The decorator uses the GSFunction method invokation system, so that parameters for the
  decorated function are automatically supplied by acquiring them from the fields of the attached function. To use the data source, simply get
  the attribute from the tool object, that has the same name as the declaration. This will be a CachedObjectSource subclass. The data is acquired
  by calling the requestObject() method, or calling the data source itself.
  The declaration can be used as a parameter for column manipulator declarations.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/09/2006)

- Creating a primitive from the 'Create' menu now selects and modifies the primitive procedure (e.g. opens the tool).
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/09/2006)

- Creating a primitive from the 'Create' menu is now correctly tracked by the command history system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/09/2006)

- Node view settings are now tracked by the command history.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/09/2006)

- Modified gSculpt so that all UI text strings use the gettext system to allow internationalisation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (15/10/2006)

- Node name above plan changes when the node is renamed in the scene window.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/10/2006)

- Integrated Turkish translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gulden Leventoglu for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gulden Leventoglu (02/11/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the tweak tool which caused incorrect edge ring and edge loop highlights to be displayed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/11/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the model layer painter system that would cause nodes to be incorrectly hidden when a project is loaded into memory
  over an existing one.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/11/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug that could cause the inset faces tool to crash in certain conditions when the 'flow through marked edges'
  option is enabled. It was caused by the MVertex::insetFacesSplitInternalEdges() method attempting to call MEdge::getRay(), passing
  a vertex to MEdge::getRay() that was not incident to the edge. This was a result of invoking MEdge::getRay() on an edge that had
  undergone an edge split, which results in the situation where it is no longer incident to one of the end points. MEdge::getRay() was
  invoked by MVertex::computeExpandEdgeScaleFactor(), invoked by MVertex::insetFacesSplitInternalEdges(), to compute
  the split-scale-factor necessary to 'expand' the face mark boundary edges. When the 'flow through marked edges' option is enabled,
  these boundary edges are split as well as the internal ones. The solution was to  work on the (face mark) boundary edges (thereby
  splitting them), handling them specially, after having worked on the (face mark) internal edges.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/11/2006)

- Implemented the new surface tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug that prevented the <alt>+<num> notebook viewport layout shortcuts from working.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/12/2006)

- Integrated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (10/12/2006)

- Replaced the signals and slots module with a new version that supports class signals, and uses an improved system for tracking
  blocked slots, and mapping slots to incoming signals.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a crash bug in the surface-tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the surface-tweak tool that prevented vertices on straight edges (a vertex with two edges whose
  directions directly oppose one another) from being tweaked correctly.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Improved performance of XML IO system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Added string variable interface and string varible types.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Replaced the GSMeta module with the KMeta module. KMeta provides additional functionality in the shape of meta-members,
  a more general system for handling columns (field columns from in DB/database, etc.), etc.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Replaced the DB (database) module with a new version that is somewhat simpler. It uses KMeta instead of GSMeta to handle
  columns, etc. GSFunctionGraph was modified to use the new hierarchy.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Modified DBEdit to use KMeta instead of GSMeta.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the new signals and slots module. Chain-connecting into a signal that was declared as a class
  signal, and not connected to any slots, resulted in a chain-connection to a temporary signal. This was due to the instance signal
  only being entered into the weak-ref signal tracking dictionary, when out-going connections were made. Instance signals are
  not entered into the tracking dictionary on creation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Removed the GSMeta module.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/12/2006)

- Fine adjustment did not work when moving components along their normal when using the surface-tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the surface-tweak tool that would produce different results when using the tool from when the
  procedure is applied as part of the node plan. This was a result of the fact that the tweak list contained references to the
  view-vector taken from the viewport camera, as opposed to copies. Since the value of this vector could change through
  viewport navigation, the references would point to this new value, as opposed to the value at the time that the tweak was
  made by the user. This was fixed by taking a copy of the view-vector when recording it.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/12/2006)

- Refactored all invoke() methods in subclasses of GSProcedure to access their field values by 'self.field', rather than using the
  field-value-to-method-argument extraction system. Due to the fact that decorators are not longer required for the invoke()
  methods, all these methods have been renamed to procedureInvoke(). This was due to the fact that invoke() needs to check
  the input product to see if it can be processed. GSProcedure.invoke() now calls procedureInvoke() after performing these
  checks.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/12/2006)

- Refactored all adjustable invokers to access values from GSProcedure fields by 'self._proc.field', rather than using the
  field-value-to-method-argument extraction system. Modified GSFunctionAdjustableInvoker to use the 'Row' class 'get value'
  listener/notification system to determine which fields in a procedure are accessed, rather than the
  field-value-to-method-argument extraction system. This simplified GSFunctionAdjustableInvoker somewhat.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/12/2006)

- Renamed ObjectSource.requestObject() and ObjectSource.requestObjectAsClass() to getValue() and getValueAsClass().
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/12/2006)

- Implemented ObjectSourceProxy, a read-only version of VarProxy. Modified VarProxy to derive from ObjectSourceProxy.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/12/2006)

- Modified ColumnEditor so that it derives from KMetaMember, and RowEditor so that it derives from Row.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/12/2006)

- Refactored all RowEditor subclasses to access field columns through a row-reference column (called 'row') that references
  the corresponding row class. All data source methods were refactored to use FieldColumn. The result of these modifications
  is a simplified and unified architecture. Also, the KFunction module was left unused as a result, so it was removed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/12/2006)

- Improved 'slide edges' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the class/object version Xml IO code in the Row class.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/12/2006)

- Removed hack in the tweak, surface tweak, bandsaw, and n-bandsaw tools. These tools required some extra parameters
  to control the operation of the manipulators (target and constraints, target, stop at marked edges, stop are marked edges
  and number of cuts respectively). The variables representing these parameters were members of the manipulators. The
  respective column manipulators would expose them using a special declaration. This system was a hack. It has been
  replaced; since RowEditor (and therefore all tool classes) is a subclass of Row, the parameters can now be represented/
  managed by fields in the tool class. The manipulators and UI now operate on these fields.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/12/2006)

- Modified ColumnEditor such that column editors can only edit columns that are members of the class in which the
  column editor is declared.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/12/2006)

- Implemented the 'draw quad mesh' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/12/2006)

- Implemented the 'camera focus' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the edge slide adjustments which prevented changes from being made when the slide
  factor was changed from a non-zero value to zero. This caused undo operations to give the appearance of not working.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Implemented the drawing templates interface.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Implemented the drawing plane and drawing plane tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Improved the usability of the rotation manipulator by modifying the ring handles so that you drag them in the direction of
  the ring, rather than always right and left.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Improved the usability of the rotation manipulator by allowing the sphere component of the handle to be moved by
  dragging outside the bounds of the manipulator.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- The rotation handles now snap properly; it used to be the case that the value was snapped, but the rotation of the visual
  handle itself was not.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the 3D scale manipulator that caused a stack dump when snapping was used. This was
  due to ManipulatorSnapping.snapVector2() method being used to snap a Vector3, instead of
  ManipulatorSnapping.snapVector3().
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/12/2006)

- Implemented background model drawing templates.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Implemented transparent rendering of background models.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the Kernel.DB module that caused a stack dump when trying to read or write a row that
  contained function columns to an XML file.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Implemented 'Template tweak vertices' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Discovered and bug in the background model drawing template system. It would have resulted in being able to 'draw' onto
  an out of date version of the model currently being edited. Fixed by modifying the background model layer painter to
  handle drawing template responsibilities.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a crash bug in the 'draw quad mesh' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Marked edges are now highlighted with a sea-green colour to make it easier to discern them from unmarked ones.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a crash bug in the 'draw quad mesh' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (28/12/2006)

- Implemented the 'draw face' tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/12/2006)

- Implemented the 'select node' (presented to the user as 'choose model') tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/12/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the mesh import code that can result in isolated vertices being present in a mesh.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/12/2006)

- Fixed a bug in the OBJ import code that can result in unused vertices being added to a model.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the 'Save as' dialog box that would result in the file being saved even if the 'Cancel' button
  was pressed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/12/2006)

- Refactored the UI action system so that editable accelerators will be easier to add to gSculpt.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/12/2006)

- Implemented the shortcut management and editing system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/12/2006)

- Converted all uses of UIAction and accelerators to use the new UI action system. All shortcuts can now be configured by the user.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/12/2006)

- Discovered and fixed a bug; all variable editors start in the sensitive state, before having any variables attached.
  This is incorrect. All variable editors have been modified to start in the insensitive state.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (31/12/2006)

- Modified FunctionField so that it tracks and responds to changes in fields belonging to rows that are external to the row that
  owns the function field.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/01/2007)

- Reorganised shortcut hierarchy.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/01/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (06/01/2007)

- Fixed a bug in the focus tool that prevented the viewport from being updated when the focus function was used.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/01/2007)

- Made the drawing templates icon more distinct from the drawing plane icon, by changing colours.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/01/2007)

- Shortcuts window now has a title.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/01/2007)

- Changed default shortcuts for shrink and grow selection from '-' and '+' to '[' and ']', to avoid interfering with numeric
  entry boxes.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/01/2007)

- Bug: the scale and rotate transformation tools (in body mode) used the origin as the pivot point, rather than the centre.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the rotation handle that would cause rotation angle text and the sphere rotation indicators
  to remain in the viewport after a rotation finishes.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/01/2007)

- Modified the shortcuts editor so that scrolling the shortcuts tree view does not scroll the column titles out of view.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/01/2007)

- Added 'Apply drawing templates' buttons to the draw face and draw quad mesh tools.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/01/2007)

- Exposed the MainApp object to scripts through the scripting environment.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/01/2007)

- Component picking now works when the pointer is outside the bounds of a mesh. Thanks to Isaac Mensah for
  suggesing this.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (12/01/2007)

- Picking now supports non-solid picking; when solid rendering is turned off, edges and vertices are picked by distance to
  the pointer, rather than through an incident face.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/01/2007)

- Improved the workflow of the extrude edges tool. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for this suggestion.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/01/2007)

- Modified default shortcuts for extrude edges and expand edges, from nothing and 'x', to 'x' and 'shift-x', respectively.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/01/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (14/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the bandsaw and n-bandsaw tools which caused a stack dump. The bug was introduced
  when out-of-bounds picking was implemented. It occured due to the fact that the bandsaw and n-bandsaw tools require
  a seed-face as well as a seed-edge to start from. Since picking an edge always used to produce a seed-face, the lack
  of one was never checked for, resulting in the bug.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (17/01/2007)

- Realised that the modifications to the bandsaw tool would make it inoperable when solid picking is not used, e.g. when
  solid rendering is off. This is a problem. Fixed by making sure that picking and edge or vertex ALWAYS returns a
  face that is incident to the edge, even when out of bounds picking is used. It chooses the face that is closest to the pointer.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (18/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug which caused the viewport type menu to be visible in viewports when the notebook view
  layout is active.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (20/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a crash bug in the MVertex::replaceVertexAttrib() method which would result in incorrect vertex
  attribute reference counts, and vertex attributes being destroyed when they shouldn't be. This occurred when a vertex
  attribute was being replaced with itself. This case is now checked for.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (22/01/2007)

- Improved texture co-ordinate generation of vertex weld operations. Previously, the mid-point was used for the texture
  co-ordinates. Now it uses one of the end points if this is required.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (22/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the draw quad mesh texture co-ordinate generation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (22/01/2007)

- Implemented the fill edges tool. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for this suggestion.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (23/01/2007)

- Model origin is not drawn any longer, as it has no use.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/01/2007)

- Modified the ModelPainter, MeshPainter, and ModelDraw modules so that the model drawing colours can be altered.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/01/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the draw face, draw quad mesh, target weld, and rewire edge tools that can cause
  the context menu to become in-operable when the tool is terminated using undo. Invoking undo would cause the tool
  (and therefore its manipulator) to be terminated before the edit/user-interaction cycle was completed. In this case,
  a context button listener was not removed, resulting in a dead listener blocking lower priority listeners, such as the
  toolset whose responsibility it is to manage context menus. The manipulators for these tools have been modified
  so that the context button listener is removed when the manipulator is detached from the view.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/01/2007)

- Fixed a bug in the GLUploadImage module that caused a stack dump and impared functionality if a paletted image
  was loaded as a background image. This was due to the ImageError exception not being defined. Fixed by
  converting palleted images to non-paletted, and raising a ValueError if the image mode cannot be handled.
  The ValueError is now handled in the Texture class.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/01/2007)

- Moved all colour constants into the ModelDraw module, so that they can be modified from one module.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/02/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a stack dump bug in the knife tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (02/02/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug in the rewire edges tool; was caused by the fact that MMesh::pickVertexThruEdge
  was rendered non-operational.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/02/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal reported a bug in which caused a stack dump, when File->New is used, when tabbed view
  layout is active. Triggered by attempting to remove a drawing template from a viewport, where the drawing
  template has not been added to the viewport previously; since DT's were stored as a set, attempting to remove
  it resulted in a KeyError being raised; it was not handled. This exception is now caught. In addition, ModellerView
  was not adding and removing DT's from viewports that are added to or removed from the view.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/02/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (03/02/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal reported a crash bug, caused by enabling live subdivision. Fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/02/2007)

- Implemented view drawing settings (colours, sizes, etc.) user interface, and editor window. Added menu item to
  the 'Edit' menu to invoke the view drawing settings window. View drawing settings are loaded and saved at startup
  and shutdown respectively. Thanks to Gary Rose for the suggestion.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/02/2007)

- gSculpt windows now use the new gSculpt icon, and the new splash screen is displayed at start up. Many thanks
  to Gary Rose for designing the icons and splash screen.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gary Rose (08/02/2007)

- Shortcut and view drawing settings configurations can now be imported and exported.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/02/2007)

- Shortcut key collisions are now displayed in the shortcuts editor.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/02/2007)

- Modified the Win32 build routines and installer so that the new gSculpt icons supplied by Gary Rose are used for
  the executable program, and the start menu and desktop shortcuts.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/02/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal spotted some untranslated strings. This was due to gettext not being used everywhere. Fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/02/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (10/02/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered a bug with the view drawing settings system that resulted in changes to the grid
  colours only being applied to viewports that are currently visible. Fixed by having ModellerView store the grid
  colours when they are set, and applying them to any viewports that are added.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/02/2007)

- Maarten van Limburg (Maali) discovered a bug in the rift edges tool.Fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (11/02/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal noticed a performance problem with the Win32 version of gSculpt when using the notebook
  view layout; gSculpt appears to slow down. It was caused by 'redraws' being sent to all of the viewports in the
  notebook, including all the hidden ones. The notebook pages that are hidden do not get unrealised, so there is
  no immediate way of telling whether a page is visible or not, so redraws get sent (resulting in rendering) whether
  this is necessary or not. In order to remedy this, DrawingAreas can now be 'frozen', in which case redraw requests
  are ignored. Viewports can also be frozen (by passing the request onto the drawing area). The notebook view
  layout keeps track of which viewport is visible, an ensures that all the others are frozen.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (14/02/2007)

- rw discovered a bug in the draw quad mesh tool. If 'close columns' and 'close rows' are enabled before drawing any
  quads, gSculpt crashes when the pointer is moved into the viewport. It was traced to an array out-of-bounds access.
  Fixed.

- Gary Rose and Gergely (Greg) Gaal reported a memory leak. It was caused by the RequestPainter module calling
  ObjectPainter.setObject() to supply a new product to a painter. In this case, the Python garbage collector would
  not destroy a product that had been supplied to the painter via setObject() as it considered the painter to be
  a referrer of the product, as there was no way of breaking the association. This would prevent many product
  objects from being garbage collected; hence the memory leak.

- Gary Rose reported a BAD bug. It seemed to result in models being saved incorrectly. The cause was tracked down
  to the imported module procedure. It was caused by ProcImportedModel.procedureInvoke() returning the
  imported model, instead of a copy. This could result in procedures further down altering the model stored in
  the imported model procedure, instead of working on a copy.

- Implemented duplicate faces tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (24/02/2007)

- Gary Rose reported a VERY BAD bug. It resulted in corrupted models. It was due to MMesh bounding box trees
  being refreshed incorrectly, due to the BBTree not being notified of modifications to the mesh. It was due to the fact
  that MFace::faceModified() only called MMesh::faceModified() (which notifies the BBTree that the face has been
  modified) when the faces' plane did *not* require a refresh. Sometimes, the face plane would be flagged as
  needing a refresh, so a notification would be blocked.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/02/2007)

- Modified include order of all C++ source files that include 'boost/python.hpp' so that it is included first. This
  allows gSculpt to compile on BSD systems. Thanks to Martin Tournoij for his help in developing this fix.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/03/2007)

- Discovered and fixed bugs in the model layer system. The first bug caused visibility signals from nodes loaded
  from a project file to be emitted twice. This was as a result of ModelLayerTable._p_clear() not clearing each layer
  individually, resulting in signals from nodes reaching listeners. The second bug caused nodes to be hidden or
  shown incorrectly. This was as a result of the list of the indices of hidden nodes (e.g. the current node is hidden)
  not being kept in sync with the list of visible nodes, resulting in the indices being incorrect.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/03/2007)

- Modified the UI.GtkAccelEntry module, and the shortcuts editor, so that the accelerator name displayed to the
  user is the 'more-human-readable' name resulting from gtk.accelerator_get_label(), rather than the GTK
  parseable accelerator name. This will mean that accelerators will be translated correctly.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/03/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug which caused the choose model tool to fail, such that clicking on a model would not
  select it.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/03/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered a bug in the background layer system that resulted in the current node being
  drawn in the background, as well as in the foreground. It was due to the list of indices of the hidden nodes that
  is maintained by ModelLayerBackgroundPainter not being refreshed when a node is hidden or shown.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (04/03/2007)

- Implemented and integrated new cell based data storage model. gSculpt now uses active value propagation
  throughout the system. This makes gSculpt internals much more flexible, and simplifies many problems.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/04/2007)

- Implemented a plugin loading and management system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/04/2007)

- Fixed quaternion <-> euler angle conversion. Used
  http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/rotations/conversions/quaternionToEuler/index.htm
  as a reference.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (29/04/2007)

- Incorporated Group product code from the C++ version of gSculpt. It will need updating. The merge operations
  should be modified so that merging is not done one model at a time.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2007)

- Implemented a new merge method for MMesh (MMesh::mergeWith()) which merges a mesh with the contents
  of an array of other meshes. This will result in improved performance.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (05/05/2007)

- Finished integrating the Group product code into gSculpt. A toolset for editing groups, which contains the
  deformation toolset, and a 'merge contents' tool has been implementd.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (06/05/2007)

- Implemented the 'Create Group' tool, which provides a quick way to create a group, by selecting the models that form
  the group.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/05/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (07/05/2007)

- Incorporated a new version of the greenlets library from Py lib, that is fully compatible with Python 2.5.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/05/2007)

- Modified SConstruct, so that paths for include files and libraries are determined automatically on the Win32 platform,
  getting information from the system environment.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/05/2007)

- Incorporated changes to the SConstruct build file, and the new SConstruct-install build file, contributed by Martin Tournoij.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Martin Tournoij (12/05/2007)

- Bug fix - tools shut down properly now.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (12/05/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered a number of bugs, which have now been fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (12/05/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered yet more bugs, which have now been fixed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (12/05/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (12/05/2007)

- Implemented the mesh attach tool, and the detach mesh faces operation. In order to implement the attach tool,
  methods for getting, setting, and deleting slices in GSPlan objects had to be implemented.
  Features suggested by Gary Rose.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (13/05/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (13/05/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered a bug which caused manipulators to be initially unresponsive. This was due to the fact
  that attaching a cell to the manipulator, causes it to make its underlying handle sensitive. This does not result in the
  handle determining which handle component is highlighted. This will result in events not reaching the handle component,
  hence the unresponsiveness. Fixed by refreshing the highlighted handle component when the sensitivity is changed.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (16/05/2007)

- Added a subdivide button to the face editing tool group. It creates a subdivide procedure, and initialises the 'marked
  faces only' option to true.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/05/2007)

- The target list editor did not notify the command history each time a target was removed, resulting in all 'remove' operations
  being reversed with a single undo.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/05/2007)

- Integrated the pick edge loops, pick edge rings, and pick edge boundaries tools into the pick edges tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/05/2007)

- The pick edge loops, rings, and boundaries tools are now depracated, so they were removed. Their procedure classes
  were moved into the pick edges tool module, and modified so that they convert to the new pick edge procedurs when
  they are loaded from a project file.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (26/05/2007)

- Incorporated the VRML 97 exporter that was contributed by Joerg Scheurich.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Joerg Scheurich (26/05/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (26/05/2007)

- Added explanations to the vertex, edge, and face toolsets, telling the user how to select components.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/05/2007)

- Implemented crease and normal sharpness tools.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (27/05/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (27/05/2007)

- Implemented the new proportional tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (03/06/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (05/06/2007)

- Fixed a bug in the mesh system that could prevent the bounding box tree from being updated correctly.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (09/06/2007)

- Added falloff shape option to the proportional tweak tool.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/06/2007)

- The proportional tweak tool now remembers settings (operation, falloff, radius) between uses.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (10/06/2007)

- Integrated updated Hungarian translation into gSculpt. Thanks to Gergely (Greg) Gaal for providing this translation.
  MrMeanie / Britefury, Gergely (Greg) Gaal (10/06/2007)

- Gergely (Greg) Gaal discovered a crash bug that becomes apparent when using the extrude face and tweak tools.
  It was caused by MFace::copyFrom() attempting to copy vertex normal information from the source face, even when the
  source face did not have up to date vertex normal information. It was solved by only trying to copy vertex normal
  information if the vertex normal information in the source face is up to date.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/06/2007)

- PengYou discovered a bug in the bandsaw tool. The bandsaw and n-bandsaw tools do not work correctly when the
  bandsaw path self-intersects.
  Fixed in the bandsaw tool, but not n-bandsaw.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (30/06/2007)

- Fixed the bug in the n-bandsaw tool mentioned above; n-bandsaw correctly handles situations where the cut-path
  self-intersects.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (01/07/2007)

- The crash bug mentioned in the 30/06/2007 entry (in MFace::copyFrom()) still not quite fixed yet; now checks if
  the source vertex's normal information is up to date before copying.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/07/2007)

- Discovered and fixed a bug that caused some procedures to be interpreted incorrectly when played back step by
  step. This was due to the MBBTree::copyFrom() method not copying over some flags.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (07/07/2007)

- Disabled interactive searching on the plan view list; it is of no use here, and it gets in the way when it is activated.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/07/2007)

- Small bug fixes to the MBBTree.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (19/04/2008)

- Replaced OBJ importer with new C++ version that is significantly faster than the existing Python system.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/06/2009)

- Implemented background mesh system; can draw onto background meshes, in addition to background layers.
  The mesh representation used is very simple; it contains only what is necessary to display and raytrace, nothing
  else.
  MrMeanie / Britefury (21/06/2009)
