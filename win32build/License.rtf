\par   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
\par These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
\par distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
\par gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
\par you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
\par source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
\par rights.
\par 
\par   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
\par (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
\par distribute and/or modify the software.
\par 
\par   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
\par that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
\par software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
\par want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
\par that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
\par authors' reputations.
\par 
\par   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
\par patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
\par program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
\par program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
\par patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.

\par TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par }\pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {\f1\fs20 
\par   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
\par a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
\par under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
\par refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
\par means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
\par that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
\par either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
\par language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
\par the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par 
\par Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
\par is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
\par Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
\par Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
\par 
\par   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
\par source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
\par conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
\par copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
\par notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
\par and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
\par along with the Program.
\par 
\par You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
\par you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
\par 
\par   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
\par of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
\par distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
\par     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
\par     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
\par     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
\par     parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
\par     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
\par     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
\par     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
\par     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
\par     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
\par     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
\par     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
\par     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
\par     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
\par \page 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
\par and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par collective works based on the Program.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
\par with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
\par a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
\par under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
\par Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
\par     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
\par     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
\par 
\par     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
\par     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
\par     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
\par     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
\par     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
\par     customarily used for software interchange; or,
\par 
\par     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
\par     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
\par     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
\par     received the program in object code or executable form with such
\par     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
\par 
\par The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
\par code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
\par associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
\par control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
\par special exception, the source code distributed need not include
\par anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
\par form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
\par operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
\par itself accompanies the executable.
\par 
\par If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
\par access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
\par access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
\par distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
\par compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par \page 
\par   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
\par except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
\par otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
\par void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
\par However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
\par this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
\par parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
\par Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par the Program or works based on it.
\par 
\par   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
\par Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
\par these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
\par this License.
\par 
\par   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
\par license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
\par all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
\par any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
\par apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
\par circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
\par implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par \page 
\par   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
\par certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
\par may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
\par those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
\par countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
\par the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
\par of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
\par be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\par address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
\par specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
\par later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
\par either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
\par Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
\par this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
\par Foundation.
\par 
\par   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
\par programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
\par to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
\par Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
\par make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
\par of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
\par of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

\par A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
\par ==========================
\par 
\par Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
\par Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
\par as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
\par principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
\par 
\par In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
\par National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
\par in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
\par software.
\par 
\par In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
\par BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
\par year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
\par Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
\par Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
\par non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
\par Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
\par the PSF.
\par 
\par All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
\par the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
\par releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
\par the various releases.

\par 
\par Footnotes:
\par 
\par (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
\par     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
\par     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
\par     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
\par     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
\par 
\par (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
\par     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
\par     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
\par     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
\par 
\par Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
\par direction to make these releases possible.

\par  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
\par  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
\par 
\par \tab \tab \tab     Preamble
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
\par freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
\par Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
\par free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par 
\par   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
\par specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
\par other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
\par your libraries, too.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\par price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
\par have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
\par this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
\par if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
\par in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
\par These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
\par you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
\par or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
\par you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
\par complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
\par with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
\par it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par 
\par   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
\par the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
\par permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par 
\par   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
\par that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
\par library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
\par want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
\par version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
\par the original authors' reputations.
\par \page 
\par   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
\par patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
\par software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
\par transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
\par we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
\par free use or not licensed at all.
\par 
\par   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
\par GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
\par license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
\par designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
\par one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
\par the same as in the ordinary license.
\par 
\par   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
\par they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
\par program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
\par changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
\par analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
\par a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
\par derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
\par treats it as such.
\par 
\par   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
\par Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
\par sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
\par concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
\par 
\par   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
\par users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
\par libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
\par permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
\par preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
\par libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
\par this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
\par changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
\par will lead to faster development of free libraries.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
\par "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
\par former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
\par works together with the library.
\par 
\par   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
\par General Public License rather than by this special one.
\par \page 
\par \tab \tab   GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par 
\par   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
\par contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
\par party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
\par General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
\par addressed as "you".
\par 
\par   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
\par prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
\par (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par 
\par   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
\par which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
\par Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
\par copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
\par portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
\par straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
\par included without limitation in the term "modification".)
\par 
\par   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
\par all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
\par interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
\par and installation of the library.
\par 
\par   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
\par such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
\par on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
\par writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
\par and what the program that uses the Library does.
\par   
\par   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
\par complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
\par you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
\par all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
\par warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
\par Library.
\par 
\par   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
\par and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
\par fee.
\par \page 
\par   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
\par of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
\par distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par 
\par     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
\par     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par 
\par     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
\par     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
\par     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
\par     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
\par     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
\par     in the event an application does not supply such function or
\par     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
\par     its purpose remains meaningful.
\par 
\par     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
\par     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
\par     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
\par     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
\par     root function must still compute square roots.)
\par 
\par These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
\par and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
\par it.
\par 
\par Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par collective works based on the Library.
\par 
\par In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
\par with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
\par a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
\par License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
\par this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
\par that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
\par instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
\par ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
\par that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
\par these notices.
\par \page 
\par   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
\par that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
\par subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par 
\par   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
\par the Library into a program that is not a library.
\par 
\par   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
\par derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
\par under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
\par it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
\par must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
\par medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
\par from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
\par source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
\par distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
\par compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par 
\par   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
\par Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
\par linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
\par work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
\par therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
\par 
\par   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
\par creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
\par contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
\par library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
\par Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
\par 
\par   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
\par that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
\par derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
\par Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
\par linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
\par threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par 
\par   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
\par structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
\par functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
\par file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
\par work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
\par Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par 
\par   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
\par distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
\par Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
\par whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
\par \page 
\par   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
\par link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
\par work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
\par modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
\par engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par 
\par   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
\par Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
\par this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
\par during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
\par copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
\par directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
\par of these things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
\par     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
\par     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
\par     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
\par     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
\par     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
\par     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
\par     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
\par     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
\par     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
\par     to use the modified definitions.)
\par 
\par     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
\par     least three years, to give the same user the materials
\par     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
\par     than the cost of performing this distribution.
\par 
\par     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
\par     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
\par     specified materials from the same place.
\par 
\par     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
\par     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
\par 
\par   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
\par Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
\par reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
\par the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
\par distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
\par components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
\par which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
\par the executable.
\par 
\par   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
\par restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
\par accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
\par use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
\par distribute.
\par \page 
\par   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
\par facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
\par library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
\par the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
\par permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
\par     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
\par     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
\par     Sections above.
\par 
\par     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
\par     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
\par     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
\par the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
\par attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
\par rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
\par or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par 
\par   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par the Library or works based on it.
\par 
\par   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
\par Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
\par subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
\par this License.
\par \page 
\par   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
\par license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
\par all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par 
\par If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
\par particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
\par and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\par 
\par It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par integrity of the free software distribution system which is
\par implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par impose that choice.
\par 
\par This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par 
\par   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
\par certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
\par an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
\par so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
\par excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
\par written in the body of this License.
\par 
\par   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
\par versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
\par Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
\par specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
\par "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
\par conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
\par license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
\par the Free Software Foundation.
\par \page 
\par   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
\par programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
\par write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
\par copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
\par Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
\par decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
\par of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
\par and reuse of software generally.

\par            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par 
\par   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
\par everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
\par redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
\par ordinary General Public License).
\par 
\par   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
\par safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
\par     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
\par     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
\par     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
\par     Library General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
\par     License along with this library; if not, write to the 
\par     Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, 
\par     Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
\par school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
\par necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
\par 
\par   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
\par   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
